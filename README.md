# zkSNARKs_Cryptography

The project report includes reviews of previously published Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) that operate under the MPC paradigm. We implemented HyraxZK, which has a comparatively smaller size for the proofs, increased performance, and most crucially, eliminated the need for a trusted setup. In addition to these characteristics, the proposed solution also produces proofs that are shorter and quicker than three out of five standard baseline systems that are currently widely used in practice.
